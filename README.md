> âš  **WARNING**: This is alpha software under active development. This repo is a successor to https://www.npmjs.com/package/shipengine. Until this has a stable release, we recommend you either stick to the current releases, or use the [shipengine API](https://shipengine.github.io/shipengine-openapi/).

---

## Description
An isomorphic JS library written in _typescript_ and built on the [ShipEngine API](https://shipengine.com), offering low-level access as well as convenience methods.

---

## Quick Start

Install ShipEngine via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):
```
npm install shipengine@alpha
```

The only configuration requirement is an [API key](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/auth/#api-keys).
```ts
import ShipEngine from 'shipengine'
// or, if you prefer commonjs
const ShipEngine = require('shipengine')


const shipengine = new ShipEngine('my_api_key')


const isValid = await shipengine
  .validateAddress({
    street: '1 E 161 St',
    cityLocality: 'The Bronx',
    stateProvince: 'NY',
    postalCode: '10451',
    country: 'US'
  })

console.log(isValid ? 'valid!' : 'invalid!')

```
